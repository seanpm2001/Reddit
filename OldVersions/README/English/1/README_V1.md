`üåêÔ∏èüì°Ô∏èüáÆ Reddit usage information for @seanpm2001 and also related projects.`

I started using Reddit on 2018, July 3rd. This was around the time that I stopped operating my YouTube channel (more info available [:octocat: `here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/YouTube/))

## Link to increased depression

Reddit lured me down into negative rabbitholes a few times. I decided to stop using the site as much due to this, especially at night, and actively avoid certain headlines and subreddits, as they created negativity and depression, and made it harder to sleep at night.

## Mass following

A couple of years into my time on Reddit, I began to follow subreddits en masse, and really cluttered my feed. It gives me more diverse things to read about, but causes a lot more skipping.

## Posts

I occassionally post on Reddit about technical questions, or replies to comments. I don't do it as much anymore, as I am trying to cut usage to the site.

## Subreddit

I operate the [`r/seanpm2001`](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) subreddit, although it doesn't get too much use anymore/at the moment.

## Accounts

I have 3 Reddit accounts, 2 of them are abandoned alts that I no longer have the password for:

- [`u/seanwallawalla`](https://www.reddit.com/u/seanwallawalla/) - My main account
- [`u/seanwallawalla2`](https://www.reddit.com/u/seanwallawalla2/) - My second account, which I lost access to in 2021, November
- [`???`](https://www.example.com/) - I lost access to this account in 2021, November, as I lost the username.
